These files are examples that will create, as closely as possible, the Splunk deployments described in the [Splunk Validated Architectures documentation](https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/technical-briefs/splunk-validated-architectures.pdf
).

There is no example for Distributed Non-Clustered Deployment (D1 / D11) by design.  It's discourged to deploy Splunk using the Splunk Operator for Kubernetes without the Index Clustering feature enabled.
