# This file is a placeholder for webhook manifests that will be generated
# when webhooks are implemented for the Splunk Operator CRDs.
#
# To add webhooks, implement the webhook handlers in the api/ or internal/webhook/
# directories and add the appropriate kubebuilder markers. Then run:
#   make manifests
#
# This will generate the MutatingWebhookConfiguration and/or ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
# resources needed for your webhooks.
#
# Example webhook configuration structure:
# ---
# apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
# kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
# metadata:
#   name: validating-webhook-configuration
# webhooks:
# - admissionReviewVersions:
#   - v1
#   clientConfig:
#     service:
#       name: webhook-service
#       namespace: system
#       path: /validate-enterprise-splunk-com-v4-standalone
#   failurePolicy: Fail
#   name: vstandalone.kb.io
#   rules:
#   - apiGroups:
#     - enterprise.splunk.com
#     apiVersions:
#     - v4
#     operations:
#     - CREATE
#     - UPDATE
#     resources:
