# Upgrading the Splunk Operator from 1.0.5 or older version to latest is a 
# new installation rather than an upgrade from the current operator. 
# The older Splunk Operator must be cleaned up before installing the new version. 
# Script [operator-upgrade.sh](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.1.0/operator-upgrade.sh)
# helps you to do the cleanup. The script expects the current namespace where the operator is installed and the path 
# to the latest operator deployment manifest file. The script performs the following steps
# * Backup of all the operator resources within the namespace like
#   - service-account, deployment, role, role-binding, cluster-role, cluster-role-binding
# * Deletes all the old Splunk Operator resources and deployment
# * Installs latest Splunk Operator in Splunk-operator namespace. 
# 
# By default Splunk Operator will be installed to watch cluster-wide
# Steps for upgrading prior to 1.1.0 to latest
# Set KUBECONFIG environment variable and run operator-upgrade.sh script with the following mandatory arguments
# current_namespace: current namespace where operator is installed
# manifest_file: path where latest Splunk Operator manifest file exist
#
# example 
# >operator-upgrade.sh --current_namespace=splunk-operator manifest_file=splunk-operator-install.yaml
#
# Note: This script can be run from Mac or Linux system. To run this script on Windows, use cygwin.
#
# Configuring Operator to watch specific namespace:
# Edit config-map splunk-operator-config in splunk-operator namespace, set WATCH_NAMESPACE 
# field to the namespace operator need to watch
#
# apiVersion: v1
# data:
#   OPERATOR_NAME: '"splunk-operator"'
#   RELATED_IMAGE_SPLUNK_ENTERPRISE: splunk/splunk:latest
#   WATCH_NAMESPACE: "add namespace here"
# kind: ConfigMap
# metadata:
#   labels:
#     name: splunk-operator
#   name: splunk-operator-config
#   namespace: splunk-operator
