## Metadata Parameters

All resources in Kubernetes include a `metadata` section. You can use this
to define a name for a specific instance of the resource, and which namespace
you would like the resource to reside within:

| Key       | Type   | Description                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name      | string | Each instance of your resource is distinguished using this name.                                            |
| namespace | string | Your instance will be created within this namespace. You must ensure that this namespace exists beforehand. |

If you do not provide a `namespace`, you current context will be used.

```yaml
apiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v1beta1
kind: Standalone
metadata:
  name: s1
  namespace: splunk
  finalizers:
  - enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc
```

The `enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc` finalizer is optional, and may be
used to tell the Splunk Operator that you would like it to remove all the
[Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)
associated with the instance when you delete it.


## Common Spec Parameters for All Resources

```yaml
apiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v1beta1

## Guidelines on Setting CPU/Mem resources

Set the CPU/Mem resources that can provide required bandwidth for the usecases and SLOs your Splunk deployment is intended for. The resources guidelines in Splunk operator (running Splunk on Kubernetes) for a production grade Splunk deployment are same as given in the Splunk Docs at [Capacity Plannning Manual](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.2/Capacity/IntroductiontocapacityplanningforSplunkEnterprise)


In this capacity planning manual, the 
[Reference Hardware](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.2/Capacity/Referencehardware) page provides the hardware resources specs that you should refer to for scoping and scaling the Splunk platform for your use. Once you got familiar with hardware resources specs, you can use one of the [Kubernetes Quality of Service classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/) to set the "requests" and "limits" for the Splunk deployment to meet your SLOs.

### Kubernetes Quality of Service classes:


| QoS        | Summary| Description    
| ---------- | ------- | ------- |
| Guarenteed | CPU/Mem ```requests``` = CPU/Mem ```limits```    |Every container including Splunk Container, init containers, in the Pod must have a memory limit and a memory request, and they must be the same. Further, every container including Splunk Container, init containers, in the Pod must have a CPU limit and a CPU request, and they must be the same<br>This QoS is suited best for high grade production envoronment. As your request CPU/mem setting are same as limits, the Splunk POD should have enough room in the beginining itself to address the production load. |
| Burstable | CPU/Mem ```requests``` < CPU/Mem ```limits```  | The Splunk pod does not meet the criteria for QoS class Guaranteed. At least one Container in the Splunk Pod has a memory or CPU request. <br>This QoS can be a candidate for a non prod environment where you may want to run Splunk Pods with the minimum resources, and let Kubernetes allocate more resources depending on usage. Burstable settings can also be useful during initial phase of Production environment, where you want to start with lower numbers,  measure the CPU/Mem peaks, throttling and OOMs. Eventually, adjust the resource settings to the peaks that you see most of the time. That is learning from Burstable QoS can drive setting for the Guarented QoS in case you want to use a combination of information gathered from [Reference Hardware](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.2/Capacity/Referencehardware) and information from your own experiments  |
| BestEffort | No CPU/Mem ```requests``` or ```limits``` required | For a Splunk pod to be given a QoS class of BestEffort, the Containers in the Pod must not have any memory or CPU limits or requests. This QoS can be good to use for minimal dev/test experimental purposes but not for any major splunk devloyments. |  

  
## Example of setting Splunk with Guaranteed QoS Class:

Let's look into what should be the setting for CPU/Mem resources based on the [Reference Hardware](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.2/Capacity/Referencehardware) for a standalone splunk pod. The minimumn resources requirement is "12 physical CPU cores, or 24 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater speed per core. 12GB RAM".
Assuming vCPUs, in order to make sure Kubernetes schedule the Splunk POD in a node that has above reference resources bandwith, set the CPU and Memory values for ```requests``` to 24 and 12Gi respectively. Make sure the same values are used for ```limits``` parameter also. So the yaml file will look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v1
kind: Standalone
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "12Gi"
      cpu: "24"
    limits:
      memory: "12Gi"
      cpu: "24"  
```

## Example of setting Splunk with Burstable QoS Class:
Using the similar hardware reference from the last example, you can have a Burstable QoS service by letting the Kubernetes schedule the Splunk POD in a node that can serve the CPU/Mem providided in the ```requests``` section. However, set the CPU and Memory values for ```limits``` to 24 and 12Gi respectively. 

```yaml
apiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v1
kind: Standalone
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "2Gi"
      cpu: "4"
    limits:
      memory: "12Gi"
      cpu: "24"  
```

In the above example, Splunk POD will be able to start serving the searches and ingestion that can be served by the 4 CPU cores and 2Gi memory. Subsequently, as the load grows, kubernetes will allocate additional CPU cores upto the ```limits``` of 24 CPU cores, as well as additional memory upto 12Gi.


## Example of setting Splunk with BestEffort QoS Class:

```yaml
apiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v1
kind: Standalone
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  imagePullPolicy: Always

```

### Special Considerations

__CPU Throttling__

In all the above examples, kubernetes will start throttling CPUs if the Splunk Pod's demand for CPU cycles exceeds the CPU cores provided in the ```limits``` parameter. In  cases where your nodes have enough spare CPU cores, you can leave ```limits``` undefined to let PODs use spare CPU cycles. 

__POD Eviction - OOM__

In all the above examples, kubernetes will evict a Splunk Pod from the node if the Pod try to use memory that exceeds memory set in the ```limits``` parameter. You can keep the ```requests``` and ```limits``` values for the memory same to avoid pod eviction due to OOM.

### Summary of CPU/Mem Requirements
Refering to [Reference Hardware](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.2/Capacity/Referencehardware), following is the summary of minimum CPU/Mem requirements for production environment:

| Standalone        | Search Head Cluster| Indexer Cluster|    
| ---------- | ------- | ------- |
| 12 CPU Cores or 24 vCPU, 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM. | Each Search Head: 16 CPU Cores or 32 vCPU, 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM.| Each Indexer: 12 CPU cores, or 24 vCPU at 2GHz or greater per core, 12GB RAM.|  


__Utility (Deployment Server, Cluster Manager
Monitoring Console, Deployer, License Manager)__

8 vCPU, 16GB RAM for  small/medium deployments/clusters
16 vCPU, 32GB RAM for large deployments/clusters
The Monitoring Console can be combined with Cluster Manager.
Deployer 

## Storage Guidelines

The Splunk pods must have access to storage that meets or exceeds the specs provided in the [Reference Hardware](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.2/Capacity/Referencehardware) document. 

__Key points:__

_Search Heads_ - Use SSDs for high ad-hoc, scheduled searches. If you want to use HDD, the HDD must provide 800+ sustained IIOPs. Minimum 300GB of storoge space.

_Indexers_ - Use SSDs to serve high performance of data ingestion and searches. The storage space requirement depends on the amount of data ingested per day and data retention period. 100GB/day per indexer with 30 days data retention will need 100*30*.5 = ```1500GB min space on the indexer```.  Look into the [Estimate your storage requirements](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.2/Capacity/Estimateyourstoragerequirements)page for determine right size of storage.

_Indexers with smartstore_ - Use SSDs or NVMes. In addition to the ingestion/searches processing, a smartstore enabled indexer also requires additional bandwith for data buckets cache management. If the indexer is adding approximately 100GB/day of indexed data, the recommended size reserved for cached data is 3000GB for 30 days data retention. At a minimum, provision enough storage to keep at least 7-10 days of data in cache, as searches typically occur on data indexed within the last 7 - 10 day. So that would be ```minimum of 700GB storoge```. Indexer with smartstore Have access to a remote object storage. For additional help on smartstore configuration, see this page [SmartStore Resource Guide](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/blob/develop/docs/SmartStore.md)
