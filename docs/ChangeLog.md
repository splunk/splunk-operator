* The API has been updated to v1beta1, with one new Custom Resource Definition added: ClusterMaster. Refer the revised [Custom Resources](CustomResources.md) and [Examples](Examples.md) documentation for details on all the changes. This is a major update and is not backward-compatible. You will have to completely remove any older versions, and any resources managed by the operator, before upgrading to this release.

## 0.1.0 Alpha (2020-03-20)

* This release depends upon changes made concurrently in the Splunk
  Enterprise container images. You must use the latest splunk/splunk:edge
  nightly image with it, or alternatively any release version 8.0.3 or later.

* The API has been updated to v1alpha2, and involves the replacement of
  the SplunkEnterprise custom resource with 5 new custom resources:
  Spark, LicenseMaster, Standalone, SearchHeadCluster and IndexerCluster.
  Please read the revised [Custom Resources](CustomResources.md) and
  [Examples](Examples.md) documentation for details on all the changes. This
  is a major update and is not backwards-compatible. You will have to
  completely remove any older versions, and any resources managed by the
  operator, before upgrading to this release.

* Scaling, upgrades and other updates are now more actively managed for the
  SearchHeadCluster and IndexerCluster resources. This helps protect against
  data loss and maximizes availability while changes are being made. You can
  now also use the "kubectl scale" command, and Horizontal Pod Autoscalers
  with all resources (except LicenseMaster, which always uses a single Pod).

* A new serviceTemplate spec parameter has been added for all Splunk Enterprise
  custom resources. This may be used to define a template the operator uses for
  the creation of (non headless) services.

* Splunk Enterprise clusters may now be created without having to provide a
  license file via the licenseURL parameter. When no license is provided,
  a default trial license will now be used.

* Annotations and labels from the managed custom resources are now appended
  to any corresponding Pod and Service objects that the operator creates.

* A unique pass4SymmKey secret will now be randomly generated, to resolve
  cluster manager warnings about using the default value.

* Integrated with CircleCI and Coverall for CICD and code coverage, and
  added a bunch of unit tests to bring coverage up to over 90%.

## 0.0.6 Alpha (2019-12-12)

* The operator now injects a podAntiAffinity rule to try to ensure
  that no two pods of the same type are scheduled on the same host

* Ingest updates: HEC is now always enabled by default; added S2S port
  9997 to indexer pod specs, added splunk-indexer-service, doc updates

* Fixed bugs and updated docs, YAML deployment files, roles and bindings
  to better accomodate using a single instance of the Splunk Operator to
  manage SplunkEnterprise stacks across an entire cluster (cluster scope).

* Fixed deadlock condition between deployer and search heads when
  apps_location is specified (note this this also requires a patch
  in splunk-ansible https://github.com/splunk/splunk-ansible/pull/312

* Fixed issues with randomly generated secrets sometimes containing
  characters that broken ansible's YAML parsing, causing failures
  to provision new stacks. All randomly-generated secrets now use
  only alpha-numeric characters. Exception is hec_token which now
  uses a UUID like format.

* DFS spark worker pool now uses a Deployment instead of StatefulSet

* Added annotations to get istio to not intercept certain ports

* Removed unused port 60000 from splunk-operator deployment spec

* Pod template change now log the name of the thing that was updated

## 0.0.5 Alpha (2019-10-31)

* Added port 8088 to expose on indexers, and only exposting DFC ports on search heads
* Bug fix: The spark-manager deployment was always updated during reconciliation

## 0.0.4 Alpha (2019-10-22)

* Updates to SplunkEnterprise objects are now handled, enabling deployments to be upgraded and modified after creation
* Added liveness and readiness probes to all Splunk Enterprise and Spark pods
* All Splunk Enterprise containers now run using the unprivileged `splunk` user and group
* The minimum required version of Splunk Enterprise is now 8.0
* The `splunk-operator` container now uses Red Hat's [Universal Base Image](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/ubi/) version 8

## 0.0.3 Alpha (2019-08-14)

* Switched single instances, deployer, cluster manager and license manager
from using Deployment to StatefulSet

## 0.0.2 & 0.0.1

* Internal only releases
