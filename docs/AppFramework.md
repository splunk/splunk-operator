# App Framework Resource Guide

The Splunk Operator provides support for Splunk App and Add-on deployment using the App Framework (Beta Version). The App Framework specification adds support for S3-compatible app repository, authentication, and supports specific Splunk Enterprise cluster and standalone [custom resources](https://splunk.github.io/splunk-operator/CustomResources.html) (CR).

### Prerequisites

Utilizing the App Framework requires:

* An Amazon S3 or S3-API-compliant remote object storage location. App framework requires read-only access to the path containing the apps.
* The remote object storage credentials via a secret, or an IAM role.
* Splunk Apps and Add-ons in a .tgz or .spl archive format.
* Connections to the remote object storage endpoint need to be secure using a minimum version of TLS 1.2.


### How to use the App Framework on a Standalone CR

In this example, you'll deploy a Standalone CR with a remote storage volume, the location of the app archives, and set the installation location for the Splunk Enterprise Pod instance by using `scope`.

1. Confirm your S3-based remote storage volume path and URL.

2. Configure credentials to connect to remote store by either:
   * Configure an IAM role for the Operator and Splunk instance pods using a service account or annotations, or
   * Create a Kubernetes Secret Object with the static storage credentials.
     * Example: `kubectl create secret generic s3-secret --from-literal=s3_access_key=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE --from-literal=s3_secret_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`

3. Create folders on the remote storage volume to use as App Source locations.
   * An App Source is a folder on the remote storage volume containing a subset of Splunk Apps and Add-ons. In this example, we split the network and authentication Splunk Apps into different folders and named them `networkApps` and `authApps`.

4. Copy your Splunk App or Add-on archive files to the App Source.
   * In this example, the Splunk Apps are located at `bucket-app-framework-us-west-2/Standalone-us/networkAppsLoc/` and `bucket-app-framework-us-west-2/Standalone-us/authAppsLoc/`, and are both accessible through the end point `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`.

5. Update the standalone CR specification and append the volume, App Source configuration, and scope.
   * The scope determines where the apps and add-ons are placed into the Splunk Enterprise instance. For CRs where the Splunk Enterprise instance will run the apps locally, set the `scope: local ` The Standalone, Monitoring Console and License Manager CRs always use a local scope.

Example: Standalone.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v3
kind: Standalone
metadata:
  name: stdln
  finalizers:
  - enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc
spec:
  replicas: 1
  appRepo:
    appsRepoPollIntervalSeconds: 600
    defaults:
      volumeName: volume_app_repo
      scope: local
    appSources:
      - name: networkApps
        location: networkAppsLoc/
      - name: authApps
        location: authAppsLoc/
    volumes:
      - name: volume_app_repo
        storageType: s3
        provider: aws
        path: bucket-app-framework-us-west-2/Standalone-us/
        endpoint: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com
        secretRef: s3-secret
```

6. Apply the Custom Resource specification: `kubectl apply -f Standalone.yaml`

The App Framework detects the Splunk App archive files available in the App Source locations, and deploys the apps to the standalone instance for local use. The App Framework will also scan for changes to the App Source folders based on the polling interval, and deploy updated archives to the instance. A Pod reset is triggered to install the new or modified apps.

Note: A similar approach can be used for installing apps on License Manager using it's own CR.

For more information, see the [Description of App Framework Specification fields](#description-of-app-framework-specification-fields).


### How to use the App Framework on Indexer Cluster

This example describes the installation of apps on Indexer Cluster as well as Cluster Manager. This is achieved by deploying a ClusterMaster CR with a remote storage volume, the location of the app archives, and set the installation scope to support both local and cluster app distribution.

1. Confirm your S3-based remote storage volume path and URL.

2. Configure credentials to connect to remote store by either:
   * Configure an IAM role for the Operator and Splunk instance pods using a service account or annotations, or
   * Create a Kubernetes Secret Object with the static storage credentials.
     * Example: `kubectl create secret generic s3-secret --from-literal=s3_access_key=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE --from-literal=s3_secret_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`

3. Create folders on the remote storage volume to use as App Source locations.
   * An App Source is a folder on the remote storage volume containing a subset of Splunk Apps and Add-ons. In this example, we have Splunk apps that are installed and run locally on the cluster manager, and apps that will be distributed to all cluster peers by the cluster manager. 
   * The apps are split across 3 folders named `networkApps`, `clusterBase`, and `adminApps` . The apps placed into  `networkApps` and `clusterBase` are distributed to the cluster peers, but the apps in `adminApps` are for local use on the cluster manager instance only.

4. Copy your Splunk App or Add-on archive files to the App Source.
   * In this example, the Splunk Apps for the cluster peers are located at `bucket-app-framework-us-west-2/idxcAndCmApps/networkAppsLoc/`,  `bucket-app-framework-us-west-2/idxcAndCmApps/clusterBaseLoc/`, and the apps for the cluster manager are located at`bucket-app-framework-us-west-2/idxcAndCmApps/adminAppsLoc/`. They are all accessible through the end point `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`.

5. Update the ClusterMaster CR specification and append the volume, App Source configuration, and scope.
   * The scope determines where the apps and add-ons are placed into the Splunk Enterprise instance. For CR's where the Splunk Enterprise instance will deploy the apps to cluster peers, set the `scope:  cluster`. The ClusterMaster and SearchHeadCluster CR's support both cluster and local scopes.
   * In this example, the cluster manager will run some apps locally, and deploy other apps to the cluster peers. The App Source folder `adminApps` are Splunk Apps that are installed on the cluster manager, and will use a local scope. The apps in the App Source folders `networkApps` and `clusterBase` will be deployed from the cluster manager to the peers, and will use a cluster scope.

Example: ClusterMaster.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v3
kind: ClusterMaster
metadata:
  name: cm
  finalizers:
  - enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc
spec:
  replicas: 1
  appRepo:
    appsRepoPollIntervalSeconds: 900
    defaults:
      volumeName: volume_app_repo_us
      scope: cluster
    appSources:
      - name: networkApps
        location: networkAppsLoc/
      - name: clusterBase
        location: clusterBaseLoc/
      - name: adminApps
        location: adminAppsLoc/
        scope: local
    volumes:
      - name: volume_app_repo_us
        storageType: s3
        provider: aws
        path: bucket-app-framework-us-west-2/idxcAndCmApps/
        endpoint: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com
        secretRef: s3-secret
```

6. Apply the Custom Resource specification: `kubectl apply -f ClusterMaster.yaml`

The App Framework detects the Splunk App archive files available in the App Source locations, and deploys the apps from the `adminApps`  folder to the cluster manager instance for local use. A Pod reset is triggered on the cluster manager to install any new or modified apps. The App Framework will also scan for changes to the App Source folders based on the polling interval, and deploy updated archives to the instance.

The apps in the `networkApps` and `clusterBase` folders are deployed to the cluster manager for use on the cluster. The cluster manager is responsible for deploying those apps to the cluster peers. The Splunk cluster peer restarts are triggered by the contents of the Splunk apps deployed, and are not initiated by the App Framework.

For more information, see the [Description of App Framework Specification fields](#description-of-app-framework-specification-fields)

### How to use the App Framework on Search Head Cluster

This example describes the installation of apps on Search Head Cluster as well as Deployer. This is achieved by deploying a SearchHeadCluster CR with a storage volume, the location of the app archives, and set the installation scope to support both local and cluster app distribution.

1. Confirm your S3-based remote storage volume path and URL.

2. Configure credentials to connect to remote store by either:
   * Configure an IAM role for the Operator and Splunk instance pods using a service account or annotations, or
   * Create a Kubernetes Secret Object with the static storage credentials.
     * Example: `kubectl create secret generic s3-secret --from-literal=s3_access_key=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE --from-literal=s3_secret_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`

3. Create folders on the remote storage volume to use as App Source locations.
   * An App Source is a folder on the remote storage volume containing a subset of Splunk Apps and Add-ons. In this example, we have Splunk apps that are installed and run locally on the Deployer, and apps that will be distributed to all cluster search heads by the Deployer. 
   * The apps are split across 3 folders named `searchApps`, `machineLearningApps`, `adminApps` and `ESapps`. The apps placed into  `searchApps`, `machineLearningApps` and `ESapps` are distributed to the search heads, but the apps in `adminApps` are for local use on the Deployer instance only.

4. Copy your Splunk App or Add-on archive files to the App Source.
   * In this example, the Splunk Apps for the search heads are located at `bucket-app-framework-us-west-2/shcLoc-us/searchAppsLoc/`,  `bucket-app-framework-us-west-2/shcLoc-us/machineLearningAppsLoc/`, and the apps for the Deployer are located at `bucket-app-framework-us-west-2/shcLoc-us/adminAppsLoc/`. Apps that need pre-configuration by the deployer(Ex. Enterprise Security App) before installing to the search heads are located at `bucket-app-framework-us-west-2/shcLoc-us/ESappsLoc/`. They are all accessible through the end point `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`.

5. Update the SearchHeadCluster CR specification and append the volume, App Source configuration, and scope.
   * The scope determines where the apps and add-ons are placed into the Splunk Enterprise instance. 
      * For CR's where the Splunk Enterprise instance will pre-configure before deploying to the search heads,  set the `scope: clusterWithPreConfig`.
      * For CR's where the Splunk Enterprise instance will deploy the apps(without pre-configuring) to search heads set the `scope:  cluster`. The ClusterMaster and SearchHeadCluster CR's support both cluster and local scopes. 
   * In this example, the Deployer will run some apps locally, and deploy other apps to the search heads. The App Source folder `adminApps` are Splunk Apps that are installed on the Deployer, and will use a local scope. The apps in the App Source folders `searchApps` and `machineLearningApps` will be deployed from the Deployer to the search heads, and will use a cluster scope. For the apps in the App Source folder ESapps, deployer pre-configures them, and then deploys them to the search heads.

Example: SearchHeadCluster.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v3
kind: SearchHeadCluster
metadata:
  name: shc 
  finalizers:
  - enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc
spec:
  replicas: 1
  appRepo:
    appsRepoPollIntervalSeconds: 900
    defaults:
      volumeName: volume_app_repo_us
      scope: cluster
    appSources:
      - name: searchApps
        location: searchAppsLoc/
      - name: machineLearningApps
        location: machineLearningAppsLoc/
      - name: adminApps
        location: adminAppsLoc/
        scope: local
      - name: ESapps
        location: ESappsLoc/
        scope: clusterWithPreConfig
    volumes:
      - name: volume_app_repo_us
        storageType: s3
        provider: aws
        path: bucket-app-framework-us-west-2/shcLoc-us/
        endpoint: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com
        secretRef: s3-secret
```

6. Apply the Custom Resource specification: `kubectl apply -f SearchHeadCluster.yaml`

The App Framework detects the Splunk App archive files available in the App Source locations, and deploys the apps from the `adminApps`  folder to the deployer instance for local use. A Pod reset is triggered on the deployer to install any new or modified apps. The App Framework will also scan for changes to the App Source folders based on the polling interval, and deploy updated archives to the instance.

The apps in the `searchApps` and `machineLearningApps` folders are deployed to the deployer for use on the search head cluster. The deployer is responsible for deploying those apps to the search heads. The Splunk Search Head restarts are triggered by the contents of the Splunk apps deployed, and are not initiated by the App Framework.

For more information, see the [Description of App Framework Specification fields](#description-of-app-framework-specification-fields).


## Description of App Framework Specification fields
App Framework configuration is supported on the following Custom Resources: Standalone, ClusterMaster, SearchHeadCluster, MonitoringConsole and LicenseMaster. Configuring the App framework involves the following steps:

* Remote Source of Apps: Define the remote location including the bucket(s) and path for each bucket
* Destination of Apps: Define where the Apps need to be installed (in other words, which Custom resources need to be configured)
* Scope of Apps: Define if the Apps need to be installed locally (such as Standalone, Monitoring Console and License Manager) or cluster-wide (such as Indexer cluster, Search Head Cluster)

Here is a typical App framework configuration in a Custom resource definition:

```yaml

### appRepo

`appRepo` is the start of the App Framework specification, and contains all the configurations required for App framework to be successfully configured

### volumes

`volumes` helps configure the remote storage volumes. App framework expects apps that are to be installed in various Splunk deployments to be hosted in one or more remote storage volumes

* `name` uniquely identifies the remote storage volume name within a CR. This is to locally used by the Operator to identify the volume
* `storageType` describes the type of remote storage. Currently `s3` is the only supported type
* `provider` describes the remote storage provider. Currently `aws` & `minio` are the supported providers 
* `endpoint` helps configure the URI/URL of the remote storage endpoint that hosts the apps
* `secretRef` refers to the K8s secret object containing the static remote storage access key.  This parameter is not required if using IAM role based credentials.
* `path` describes the path (including the bucket) of one or more app sources on the remote store 

### appSources

`appSources` helps configure the name & scope of the appSource, as well as remote storage volume & location

* `name` uniquely identifies the App source configuration within a CR. This is to locally used by the Operator to identify the App source
* `scope` defines the scope of the App to be installed. 
  * If the scope is `local` the apps will be installed locally on the pod referred to by the CR
  * If the scope is `cluster` the apps will be installed across the cluster referred to by the CR
  * If the scope is `clusterWithPreConfig` the apps will be pre-configured before installing across the cluster referred to by the CR
  * The cluster scope is only supported on CR's that manage cluster-wide app deployment
  
    | CRD Type          | Scope support                          | App Framework support |
    | :---------------- | :------------------------------------- | :-------------------- |
    | ClusterManager    | cluster, clusterWithPreConfig,  local  | Yes                   |
    | SearchHeadCluster | cluster, clusterWithPreConfig, local   | Yes                   |
    | Standalone        | local                                  | Yes                   |
    | LicenceMaster     | local                                  | Yes                   |
    | MonitoringConsole | local                                  | Yes                   |
    | IndexerCluster    | N/A                                    | No                    |

* `volume` refers to the remote storage volume name configured under the `volumes` stanza (see previous section)
* `location` helps configure the specific appSource present under the `path` within the `volume`, containing the apps to be installed  

### appsRepoPollIntervalSeconds

`appsRepoPollIntervalSeconds` helps configure the polling interval(in seconds) to detect addition or modification of apps on the Remote Storage

## Impact of livenessInitialDelaySeconds and readinessInitialDelaySeconds

* Splunk Operator CRDs support the configuration of [initialDelaySeconds](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) for both Liveliness (livenessInitialDelaySeconds) and Readiness (readinessInitialDelaySeconds) probes
* When App Framework is NOT configured, default values are 300 seconds for livenessInitialDelaySeconds and 10 seconds for readinessInitialDelaySeconds (for all CRs)
* When App Framework is configured, default values are 1800 seconds for livenessInitialDelaySeconds and 10 seconds for readinessInitialDelaySeconds (only for Deployer, Cluster Manager, Standalone, Monitoring Console and License Manager CRs). The higher value of livenessInitialDelaySeconds is to ensure sufficient time is allocated for installing most apps. This configuration can further be managed depending on the number & size of Apps to be installed

## App Framework Limitations

The App Framework does not review, preview, analyze, or enable Splunk Apps and Add-ons. The administrator is responsible for previewing the app or add-on contents, verifying the app is enabled, and that the app is supported with the version of Splunk Enterprise used in the containers. For App packaging specifications see [Package apps for Splunk Cloud or Splunk Enterprise](https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/releaseapps/packageapps/) in the Splunk Enterprise Developer documentation. The app archive files must end with .spl or .tgz; all other files are ignored.

1. The App Framework has no support to remove an app or add-on once it’s been deployed. To disable an app, update the archive contents located in the App Source, and set the app.conf state to disabled.

2. The App Framework tracks the app installation state per CR. Whenever you scale up a Standalone CR, all the existing pods will recycle and all the apps in app sources will be re-installed. This is done so that the new replica(s) can install all the apps and not just the apps that were changed recently.

3. When a change in the App Repo is detected by the App Framework, a pod reset is initiated to install the new or modified applications. For the ClusterMaster and SearchHeadCluster CR’s, a pod reset is applied to the cluster manager and deployer instances only. A cluster peer restart might be triggered by the contents of the Splunk apps deployed, but are not initiated by the App Framework.
