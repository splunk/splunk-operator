# Splunk Operator Helm Installation

## Splunk Operator Helm chart Repository

Add the Splunk Operator and Enterprise charts to your Helm repository.

```
helm repo add splunk https://splunk.github.io/splunk-operator/
helm repo update
```

The ```splunk``` chart repository contains the ```splunk/splunk-operator``` chart to deploy the Splunk Operator and the ```splunk/splunk-enterprise``` chart to deploy Splunk Enterprise custom resources.

Users need to deploy the latest CRDs manually. This is a [limitation](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/) from helm. The ```splunk/splunk-operator``` chart no longer contains the CRDs to install on the first deployment due to the size of the CRDs. Helm has a chart size [limit of 1MB](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/advanced/#sql-storage-backend) due to internal limits in Kubernetes' underlying etcd key-value store, and the Splunk Operator for Kubernetes CRDs are too big to fit into the helm chart to deploy the operator. To install the CRDs for the first time, or to update the CRDs to the latest versions, follow one of the following steps.

```
git clone https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator.git .
git checkout release/3.0.0
make install
```

OR

```
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/3.0.0/splunk-operator-crds.yaml --server-side
```

Helm provides a long list of commands to manage your deployment, we'll be going over a few useful ones in the sections to come. You can learn more about supported commands [here](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm/).

## Splunk Operator deployments

Installing the ```splunk/splunk-operator``` chart deploys the Splunk Operator with cluster-wide access. View the configurable values for the chart using the following command:

```
helm show values splunk/splunk-operator
```

### Configuring Splunk Operator deployments

There are a couple ways you can configure your operator deployment

1. Using a ```new_values.yaml``` file to override default values (Recommended)
```
helm install -f new_values.yaml <RELEASE_NAME> splunk/splunk-operator -n <RELEASE_NAMESPACE>
```

2. Using the Helm CLI directly to set new values
```
helm install --set <KEY>=<VALUE> <RELEASE_NAME> splunk/splunk-operator -n <RELEASE_NAMESPACE>
```

If the release already exists, we can use ```helm upgrade``` to configure and upgrade the deployment using a file or the CLI directly as above.

```
helm upgrade -f new_values.yaml <RELEASE_NAME> splunk/splunk-operator -n <RELEASE_NAMESPACE>
```

Read more about configuring values [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/).

In the following example, we will install and upgrade the Splunk Operator.

Specify the release name and namespace to install the Operator:

```
helm install splunk-operator-test splunk/splunk-operator -n splunk-operator
```
```
NAME: splunk-operator-test
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Aug 23 12:47:57 2022
NAMESPACE: splunk-operator
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```
```
NAME                                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
splunk-operator-controller-manager-545cccf79f-9xpll   2/2     Running   0          2m14s
```
The ```helm list``` command can be used to retrieve all deployed releases.

By default, the Splunk Operator has cluster-wide access. Let's upgrade the ```splunk-operator-test``` release by revoking cluster-wide access:
```
helm upgrade --set splunkOperator.clusterWideAccess=false splunk-operator-test splunk/splunk-operator -n splunk-operator
```
```
NAME: splunk-operator-test
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Aug 23 12:53:08 2022
NAMESPACE: splunk-operator
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 2
TEST SUITE: None
```
Finally, let's terminate the Splunk Operator by uninstalling the ```splunk-operator-test``` release:
```
helm uninstall splunk-operator-test -n splunk-operator
```
```
release "splunk-operator-test" uninstalled
```

## Splunk Enterprise deployments

The Splunk Enterprise chart allows you to install and configure Splunk Enterprise custom resources. The ```splunk/splunk-enterprise``` chart has the ```splunk/splunk-operator``` chart as a dependency by default. To satisfy the dependencies please use the following command:
```
helm dependency build splunk/splunk-enterprise
```
If the operator is already installed then you will need to disable the dependency:
```
helm install --set splunk-operator.enabled=false <RELEASE_NAME> splunk/splunk-enterprise -n <RELEASE_NAMESPACE>
```
Installing ```splunk/splunk-enterprise``` will deploy Splunk Enterprise custom resources according to your configuration, the following ```new_values.yaml``` file specifies override configurations to deploy a Cluster Manager, an Indexer Cluster and a Search Head Cluster.

```
clusterManager:
  enabled: true
  name: cm-test

indexerCluster:
  enabled: true
  name: idxc-test

searchHeadCluster:
  enabled: true
  name: shc-test
```
The configurations above will override values in ```splunk/splunk-enterprise``` values file.  To see all configurable values contained in the ```values.yaml``` file:
```
helm show values splunk/splunk-enterprise
```

To install a Splunk Enterprise deployment according to our configurations above:
```
helm install -f new_values.yaml splunk-enterprise-test splunk/splunk-enterprise -n splunk-operator
```
```
NAME: splunk-enterprise-test
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Aug 23 12:11:48 2022
NAMESPACE: splunk-operator
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```
```
splunk-cm-test-cluster-manager-0                      1/1     Running   0               11m
splunk-idxc-test-indexer-0                            1/1     Running   0               5m49s

splunk-shc-test-search-head-0                         1/1     Running   0               11m
splunk-shc-test-search-head-1                         1/1     Running   0               11m
splunk-shc-test-search-head-2                         1/1     Running   0               11m
```
We can clean-up the deployed resources quickly by uninstalling the release:
```
helm uninstall splunk-enterprise-test -n splunk-operator
```
```
release "splunk-enterprise-test" uninstalled
```
```helm uninstall``` terminates all resources deployed by Helm including Persistent Volume Claims created for Splunk Enterprise resources.

Note: Helm by default does not cleanup Custom Resource Definitions and Persistent Volume Claims. Splunk Admin needs to manually clean them.

### Troubleshooting Splunk Enterprise Deployments

#### CRDs are not installed
If you attempt to install a Splunk Enterprise deployment, and there is an error that says:
```
Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: unable to build kubernetes objects from release manifest: resource mapping not found for name: "release-name" namespace: "release-namespace" from "": no matches for kind "Standalone" in version "enterprise.splunk.com/v4"
ensure CRDs are installed first
```

Verify that the CRDs have been installed with the instructions at the [top of this documentation](#splunk-operator-helm-chart-repository).

## Splunk Validated Architecture deployments

The Splunk Enterprise chart has support for three Splunk Validated Architectures:

- [Single Server Deployment (S1)](https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/technical-briefs/splunk-validated-architectures.pdf#page=9)
- [Distributed Clustered Deployment + SHC - Single Site (C3)](https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/technical-briefs/splunk-validated-architectures.pdf#page=14)
- [Distributed Clustered Deployment + SHC - Multi-Site (M4)](https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/technical-briefs/splunk-validated-architectures.pdf#page=20)

Install a Standalone deployment using the following command:
```
helm install --set s1.enabled=true <RELEASE_NAME> splunk/splunk-enterprise -n <RELEASE_NAMESPACE>
```
Visit the Splunk Operator github repository to learn more about the configurable values of [splunk/splunk-operator](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/blob/develop/helm-chart/splunk-operator/values.yaml) and [splunk/splunk-enterprise](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/blob/develop/helm-chart/splunk-enterprise/values.yaml).
